## 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Clone the Repository**

Start by cloning this repository to your local machine.


git clone https://github.com/amir2965/Self-Service-Food-Ordering-Kiosk.git
cd Self-Service-Food-Ordering-Kiosk
2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies
Install the required dependencies using npm or yarn.

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install
# or
yarn install
This will install all the necessary packages listed in the package.json file.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up Environment Variables
To configure the project‚Äôs environment variables (such as JWT Secret or database credentials), you'll need to create a .env file.

Steps:
Copy the .env.example file to a new file named .env:

bash
Copy
Edit
cp .env.example .env
Edit the .env file with your own values. For example:

plaintext
Copy
Edit
JWT_SECRET=your-own-secret-key-here
üîë Generate a Secure JWT Secret
To generate a strong and secure JWT Secret, you can run the following command in your terminal:

bash
Copy
Edit
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex'))"
This will output a random 64-byte string that you can use as your JWT_SECRET value.

‚ö†Ô∏è Important:
Do not push the .env file to GitHub for security reasons.
Ensure that your .env file is added to the .gitignore file to prevent accidental commits.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Running the Project Locally
Once you have all the dependencies installed and the environment variables set up, you can start the project with the following command:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm start
# or
yarn start
This will start the application on your local server, typically accessible at http://localhost:3000. Check the logs to confirm the port and any other details.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Additional Configuration (Optional)
Cloud Deployment:
If you're planning to deploy this project to the cloud (e.g., Heroku, AWS, etc.), you can set the environment variables in the respective platform's interface.

For Heroku, for example, you can set the JWT_SECRET like this:

bash
Copy
Edit
heroku config:set JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
For AWS or Google Cloud, you can store your secrets in their respective Secret Manager services for secure management.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Troubleshooting
Here are some common issues and their fixes:

Missing Dependencies:
If you see errors related to missing modules, try running the following command again:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install
# or
yarn install
JWT Secret Undefined:
If you encounter errors saying that JWT_SECRET is undefined, double-check your .env file and ensure the variable is properly set.

üîí Security Reminder
Always generate strong secrets for production environments.
Never expose sensitive information such as API keys, database passwords, or JWT secrets in the codebase.
